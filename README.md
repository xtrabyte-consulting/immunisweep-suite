# Signal Generator Auto-Frequency Sweep and Closed-Loop Power Controller Desktop Application

## Desktop application that utilizes the PyQt framework and custom SCPI and serial drivers to run frequency sweeps on an extra-wide-band (2kHz - 6GHz) RF Signal Generator while keeping the electromagnetic field at a constant amplitude via closed-loop control from a field probe's feedback input

### FieldIntensityController.py

- Root of the application: Sets up UI, connects UI actions with hardware control and information feedback from device drivers via Signals and Slots. Also runs the PID loop for steady-state field control via the Signal Generator's output and Field Probe's composite field input.

### FieldProbe.py

- File for all supported Field Probes at the moment with the aim to make the interface as modular as possible with the controller
- Contains some objects for software testing without hardware-in-the-loop and the **ETSLindgrenHI6006** class for use with the customer's onsite hardware, with a custom dynamic serial reading protocol on a thread separate from the UI that reads exact expected string lengths given write command query to avoid any application lag given serial's large over head in Python.

### SignalGenerator.py

- File containing both a test Signal Generator class for pure software testing as well as the **AgilentN5181A** object. In this class, the modulation type, power, and state of the signal is set, and the frequency sweep functions are run here as well. The **AgilentN5181A** object uses SCPI over ethernet to command the current frequency, power, modulation scheme, etc.,.

### MainWindow.py

- Autogenerated from the XML file created by Qt Designer

### LivePlot.py

- MatPlotLib embedded plots to display the frequency sweeps and the measured field intensities vs the set-point.

### Resources.qrc/py

- UI Asset resource files for bundling application across Operating Systems.
